[cromwell](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)-based pipelines for processing sample files using [Skyline](https://skyline.gs.washington.edu/labkey/project/home/software/Skyline/begin.view?). These cromwell workflows are using [Workflow Description Language](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl#getting-started-with-wdl) (WDL). Examples using [Common Workflow Language](https://www.commonwl.org/) (CWL) are coming soon. 

Each folder contains a different workflow.
